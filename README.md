# Secret Keeper Web Application

Secret Keeper is a web application built using Node.js and Express.js that allows users to register, login, and share their secrets anonymously. Users can sign up using either their email and password or their Google account. Once logged in, users can submit their secrets, which will be displayed anonymously on the "Secrets" page for all users to see.
